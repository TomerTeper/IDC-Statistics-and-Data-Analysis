## Homework Assignments Overview

### Homework 1: Statistical and Probabilistic Methods
- **Overview:**
  This homework involves applying statistical and probabilistic methods to six different problems, covering topics from defective product analysis to multinomial distributions and the coupon collector problem.
  
- **Key Topics Covered:**
  - Defective products analysis
  - Rent distributions in a fictional country (Randomistan)
  - Multinomial distributions and empirical moments
  - Convolutions
  - String similarity counting
  - The Coupon Collector problem

### Homework 2: Data Exploration, Independence, and Distributions
- **Overview:**
  This homework focuses on data exploration, independence, conditional independence, and distribution analysis through five key questions. It involves working with the `Diabetes` dataset, probability theory, Markov chains, and normal distributions.
  
- **Key Topics Covered:**
  - Data exploration and visualization
  - Correlation analysis
  - Independence and conditional independence
  - Normally distributed random variables
  - Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
  - Markov chains and transition matrices
  - Ordered statistics and binomial distributions

### Homework 3: Differential Gene Expression in Acute Myocardial Infarction
- **Overview:**
  In this assignment, students analyze gene expression profiles to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) compared to healthy individuals. The focus is on statistical tests, data pre-processing, and visualization techniques for biological data.
  
- **Key Topics Covered:**
  - Data pre-processing and cleaning
  - Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test (WRS) for differential expression
  - Student’s t-test for gene expression comparison
  - Boxplot visualization for gene expressions
  - Spearman ρ correlation analysis
  - Differential expression overabundance plots
  - Robust Differentially Expressed Genes (RDEG) analysis
  - Heatmap generation for gene expression patterns
