# Homework 1: Statistical and Probabilistic Methods

## Overview:
This homework contains six exercises that to apply statistical and probabilistic methods to various problems, ranging from defective product analysis to multinomial distributions and the coupon collector problem.

### Key Topics Covered:
- Defective products analysis
- Rent distributions in a fictional country (Randomistan)
- Multinomial distributions and empirical moments
- Convolutions
- String similarity counting
- The Coupon Collector problem

### Questions Overview:
1. **Defective products**: Analyze a manufacturing pipeline where 3% of products are defective.
   
2. **Rent distributions in Randomistan**: Analyze rent distributions in a hypothetical country called Randomistan.

3. **Multinomial Distributions**: 
   - Work with a multinomial random variable.
   - Conduct experiments and calculate the empirical centralized third moment.
   - Compare the results with theoretical expectations.

4. **Convolutions**: Apply convolutions, likely within the context of signal processing or probability.

5. **Counting Similar Strings**: Analyze and count similar strings using appropriate mathematical techniques.

6. **Coupon Collector Problem**: Calculate the waiting time for collecting all \( N \) types of coupons in the classic coupon collector's problem.
